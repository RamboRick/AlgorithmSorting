# AlgorithmSorting
Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort.

For random number:  Quick Sort is the fastest.

What about the presorted data and the reverse sorted data?
- Insertion sort is the fastest in presorted array
- Merge sort is the fastest in reverse sorted data

This quick sort always chooses the first element as its pivot because in the reverse-sorted array, the first element is the largest and nothing changes after first scanning.
